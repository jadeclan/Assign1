            Smart, committed, capable and hard working.  Oh wait .....
            Cute, friendly, caring, wee bit shy, Italian chick.  Oh wait .....
            Style queen, widget gadgeter, javaScript effect expert
            But does she keep her promises?
            Where's the dress? One of her team mates from Web II
            wanted to know?

            When the world sees red, Nolan sees orange.  When his buddies
            say they are faster, he shows them.  A quick study, but a slow
            starter -- team morning meetings negotiated to as close as
            possible to lunch time -- something about beauty rest.  A flair
            for styling with a penchant for minimalistic php and javaScript
            functions that call other minimalistic functions to get the job
            done.  Quiet, steady, easy going team mate.

            Crazy Irish?  Have you seen the code he wrote for the MVC controller?
            Crazy Irish?  Did he really convince the group to follow him down the MVC rabbit hole?
            Crazy Irish?  Coach, educator, facilitator, thinker
            Need to see recursive code in action?
            Want to see minimalistic PHP coding style?
            Looking for obscure PHP commands to do a job perfectly?
            Yup Crazy is right!  No idea about the Irish part.
            The strong, silent type - almost apologetic about helping his team mates
            reach professional understandings of php /  javascript / mysql and server
            management.  On top of all that flattery, he enjoys a good beer! Ooops
            wrong O'Donnell on the picture.

            Wise, handsome, athletic, we could go on, but it would only embarass him.
            Never does something in 30 minutes when a whole day is available.
            When asked to add 2 and 2, he was observed to convert it to binary and
            end up with 100 perhaps that's why he's retired?  The team begged him
            to do the color styling, but were not prepared for the post apocalyptic
            neo modernistic clash style that he brought to the project.  He naturally
            slid into his other roles -- poker, prodder, documenter and integrator.
            All in all, one can say with confidence that James is the oldest in the
            group, class, and program.  Betting money is he won't graduate, but will
            make Nolan get up earlier!
