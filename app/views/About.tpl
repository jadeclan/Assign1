                    Smart, committed, capable and hard working.  Oh wait .....
                    Cute, friendly, caring, wee bit shy, Italian chick.  Oh wait .....
                    Style queen, widget gadgeter, javaScript effect expert
                    But does she keep her promises?
                    Where's the dress? One of her team mates from Web II
                    wanted to know?

                    When the world sees red, Nolan sees orange.  When his buddies
                    say they are faster, he shows them.  A quick study, but a slow
                    starter -- team morning meetings negotiated to as close as
                    possible to lunch time -- something about beauty rest.  A flair
                    for styling with a penchant for minimalistic php and javaScript
                    functions that call other minimalistic functions to get the job
                    done.  Quiet, steady, easy going team mate.

                    Crazy Irish?  Have you seen the code he wrote for the MVC  controller? Crazy Irish?  Did he really convince the group to follow him down the MVC rabbit hole? Crazy Irish?  Coach, educator, facilitator, thinker Need to see recursive code in action? Want to see minimalistic PHP coding style? Looking for obscure PHP commands to do a job perfectly? Yup Crazy is right!  No idea about the Irish part. The strong, silent type - almost apologetic about helping his team mates reach professional understandings of php /  javascript / mysql and server management. On top of all that flattery, he enjoys a good beer! Ooops wrong O'Donnell on the picture.

                    Wise, handsome, athletic, we could go on, but it would only embarass him.
                    Never does something in 30 minutes when a whole day is available.
                    When asked to add 2 and 2, he was observed to convert it to binary and
                    end up with 100 perhaps that's why he's retired?  The team begged him
                    to do the color styling, but were not prepared for the post apocalyptic
                    neo modernistic clash style that he brought to the project.  He naturally
                    slid into his other roles -- poker, prodder, documenter and integrator.
                    All in all, one can say with confidence that James is the oldest in the
                    group, class, and program.  Betting money is he won't graduate, but will
                    make Nolan get up earlier!
